            <h1>The chicken wakes up like she does every morning
                To the sounds of her husband's screams
                Sat in the dark on the eggs she is warming
                She closes her eyes and dreams of
                Walking to Memphis, becoming a dentist
                Anything but this
                I mean, she likes her life as a mother and wife
                But is that all she is?
                She stares out the window

                The very next morning, the chicken decides to
                Make her escape, get a taste of freedom
                She runs out the coop that her life's been confined to
                Suddenly sees the thing she's only dreamed of
                Just up ahead, gophers run through a meadow
                Deer graze, birds sing
                Her future is waiting, right there for the taking
                There's just one thing
                </h1 >
