        The chicken wakes up like she does every morning
        To the sounds of her husband's screams
        Sat in the dark on the eggs she is warming
        She closes her eyes and dreams of
        Walking to Memphis, becoming a dentist
        Anything but this
        I mean, she likes her life as a mother and wife
        But is that all she is?
        She stares out the window
        
        The very next morning, the chicken decides to
        Make her escape, get a taste of freedom
        She runs out the coop that her life's been confined to
        Suddenly sees the thing she's only dreamed of
        Just up ahead, gophers run through a meadow
        Deer graze, birds sing
        Her future is waiting, right there for the taking
        There's just one thing</div>
